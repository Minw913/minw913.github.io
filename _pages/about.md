My background combines urban planning, GIS, and data science:

**Spatial Pleasure Inc.**  
<span>Data Scientist</span><span style="float: right;">_2024/09 - Present_</span>  

**The London School of Economics and Political Science**  
<span>M.S. Geographic Data Science</span><span style="float: right;">_2023/09 – 2024/11 (Expected)_</span>  

**Nanjing University**
<br>
<span>B.E. Urban and Rural Planning</span><span style="float: right;">_2018/09 – 2023/06_</span>

I developed a strong interest in the intersection of urban studies and data science during my studies in [Urban and Rural Planning](https://arch.nju.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University, where the program emphasized practice with geographic information systems (GIS). After my undergraduate degree, I pursued a Master’s in [Geographic Data Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/msc-geographic-data-science) at LSE to focus more on data-driven research. The program, concentrating on spatial econometrics and machine learning, allowed me to hone my skills in statistics and programming, while also benefiting from a diverse, international environment.

Upon completing my master’s thesis, in order to gain insight into real-world problems and industry needs, I have started remote work at [Spatial Pleasure](https://spatial-pleasure.xyz/en/page/2/) since September. It is a Tokyo-based company oriented towards re-optimizing the city through decarbonization of the transportation domain.

Currently, I am actively seeking potential PhD opportunities, aiming to continuously challenge myself and explore the frontiers of research. My research interests mainly lie in transportation optimization and behavior modeling; spatially-explicit GEOAI and urban computing.
