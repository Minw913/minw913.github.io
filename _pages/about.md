My past experiences combine the interdisciplinary field of urban planning, GISphere, and data science. Benefiting from studying Urban and Rural Planning in Nanjing University with its emphasis on geographic information systems, I developed a strong interest in the intersection of urban studies and data science. After completing my undergraduate studies, I sought to a transition towards a more data-driven and programming-oriented research paradigm. The Master program [MSc Geographic Data Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/msc-geographic-data-science) at LSE is a program driven by spatial econometrics and data science, with courses related to machine learning offered under the Department of Statistics. During my time there, I received further training in mathematical statistics and programming. The diversity and international environment at LSE also allowed me to meet many enthusiastic and friendly classmates with rich data science work experience. 

In order to gain insight into real-world problems and industry needs，shortly after completing my master’s thesis, I have started remote work at [Spatial Pleasure](https://spatial-pleasure.xyz/en/page/2/) since September, a Tokyo-based company primarily focused on re-optimizing the city through decarbonization of the transportation domain.

I have had some academic research experience in the past and am eager to continue deepening my expertise in the field I am passionate about. I also enjoy the atmosphere and life in a university campus. Therefore, I am actively seeking potential PhD opportunities, aiming to continuously challenge myself and explore the frontiers of research. My current research interests mainly lie in **transportation optimization and behavior modeling**; **spatially-explicit GEOAI and urban computing**.



**Hobbies**
In my spare time, I enjoy following various mystery, fantasy and science fiction novels, TV shows, and podcasts. It would be great if I could become an amateur illustrator of sci-fi novels in the future! I relate somewhat to the word Neophile, as I am a person who holds a positive attitude toward new things, innovation, and change. I have a strong enthusiasm for new technologies and emerging ideas, which might be the underlying motivation driving me to continuously study in data science field.
